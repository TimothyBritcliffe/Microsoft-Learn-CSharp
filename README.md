This repo contains all of the projects that are in the Microsoft Learn link. The Certification in partnership with freeCodeCamp only covers the "Learn C#" section shown via the Microsoft URL, however I have included the additional projects from the 'Web apps', 'Backend APIs and Microservices', and 'Mobile Desktop Applications'.
