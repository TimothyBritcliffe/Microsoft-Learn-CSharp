This repository contains the projects from the Microsoft Learn "Get started with C#" program which contains six learning paths with a focus on developing console applications using C#.
This introduction falls under the .NET product training as well as the 'Beginner' section in the 'Developer' career path under the section name "Learn C#".

This section is also tied to a freeCodeCamp certification with I have completed alongside the Microsoft Learn content.
