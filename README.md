This repository contains the projects from the Microsoft Learn "Learn C#" section which is an introduction to the C# programming language and an introduction to developing CLI based applications. 
This introduction to C# falls under the .NET product training as well as the 'Beginner' section in the 'Developer' career path. 

This section is also tied to a freeCodeCamp certification with I have completed alongside the Microsoft Learn content.
